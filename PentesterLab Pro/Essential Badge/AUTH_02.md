# AUTHE_02   
**Description:**
This example is similar to the previous example. As soon as you receive a cookie from an application, it is always good to see what it looks like. Try to crack it using a password cracker or try to just Google it. From that you should be able to generate a valid cookie for the user ```admin```.  
**Advice:**       
 If you get the same session ID many times when logging in: there is a problem! If you log in from a clean browser, you should never get the same cookies twice.

Again, we look at the cookie value that is set after logging in (username = ```delilled```):
```
Set-Cookie: auth=32ac4ff6ff36d07da4427a06856e18bb
```
Two things come to mind: hex encoding and hashing. Using CyberChef, it's easy to rule out simple hex encoding. 

From the challenge description, we can expect a simple hashing algorithm; the most obvious of which is md5. The tool has-identifier (included in Kali) could also be used to find out which hashing algorithms output a value of this length. Using CyberChef again, we can easily see that ```delilled``` hashes to ```32ac4ff6ff36d07da4427a06856e18bb```.

Hash ```admin``` and set this value (```21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3```) as the auth cookie to be logged in as admin.
