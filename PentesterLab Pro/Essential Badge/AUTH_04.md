# AUTH_04     
**Description:**     
To remediate the previous issue, the developer decided to use a case sensitive comparison during users' creation. This check can also be bypassed based on the way MySQL performs string comparison: MySQL ignores trailing spaces (i.e.: ```pentesterlab``` and ```pentesterlab[space]``` are equals). Using the same method as above, you should be able to pretend to be logged in as the user ```admin```.

**General advice:**  
A good way to prevent this issue is to tell the database that the username is a PRIMARY KEY. This method is, for example, used in Tomcat documentation to use a SQL backend as a Realm.

Again, too spoilery. Register a username with trailing spaces (```admin[space][space]```) to get the flag.
