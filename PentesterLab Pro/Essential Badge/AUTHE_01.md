# AUTHE_01
The goal of this challenge is to be logged in as ```admin```. 

The solution is relatively trivial after seeing the cookie that is set after registering/logging in:
```
Set-Cookie: auth=delilled
```
Obviously, intercepting this value or changing the cookie using the browser allows you to log in using any account. Change the cookie value to ```admin``` and collect the flag.
