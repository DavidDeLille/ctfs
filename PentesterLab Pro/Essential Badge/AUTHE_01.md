# AUTHE_01

**Description:**  
In this exercise, you can log in as ``user1``. Your goal is to get logged in as ```admin```. To do so, you need to carefully look at the response sent back by the server.  
You can see that when you log in as ```user1```, you get a cookie named ```user1```. From that you can easily modify this value (using a proxy or a browser's extension) to get logged in as ```admin```. 
---

The solution is relatively trivial after seeing the cookie that is set after registering/logging in:
```
Set-Cookie: auth=delilled
```
Obviously, intercepting this value or changing the cookie using the browser allows you to log in using any account. Change the cookie value to ```admin``` and collect the flag.
