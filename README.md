# CTFs
This repo contains my write-ups for security Capture The Flags, wargames, or similar exercises. The goal is to keep a record for myself, improve my writing nd MarkDown skills, and to allow others to look up the answers if they so choose. If you are the owner of a CTF/wargame and would like me to remove a write-up, please create an issue and I will do so. 

MarkDown code for challenge information:
