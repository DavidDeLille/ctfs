Xuxu is worrying about how to fill up his disk space with things so that it looks like he didnâ€™t waste money on this 1 TB monster. He found a tool to compress his data with a compression rate of more than 100,000,000%.

But the problem is, the author of the tool was too lazy to give a decompression program. Please help Xuxu figure out what the hell his original data is.
